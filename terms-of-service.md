## Last modified: May 2016

## 1. Your relationship with Pear Deck

1.1 Your use of Pear Deck’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Pear Deck. “Pear Deck” means Pear Deck Inc., whose principal place of business is at 320 E. Prentiss St, Iowa City, IA 52240, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

1.2 These Terms of Service form a legally binding agreement between you and Pear Deck in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. This legal agreement is referred to below as the "Terms".

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN

1.3	Generally. Our Site offers certain Services to schools for the benefit of the schools and their students. In providing such educational Services, we may collect personal information from students. In order to collect, use, or disclose personal information from users under 13 years of age ("Children"), we are required to comply with the Federal Trade Commission Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Please read this Children’s Privacy Policy carefully as it explains (a) our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from Children who use the Service, (b) the Child’s parent’s or guardian’s (“Parent’s”) ability to limit the collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected from their Children, and (c) the role of the Child’s school (“School”) in this process.

1.4	Parents. If your Child wants to use our Services, he/she must first get an Account from her school. Please contact your Child’s school for an Account. Please also review Pear Deck’s Children’s Privacy Policy.

1.5	Schools. If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of a School:

(a)	You represent and warrant that: (i) you have read Pear Deck’s Privacy Policy; and (ii) with respect to students at your School who are Children and are using this Site ("Child Students"), the School has the authority to act as the agent of the Child Students’ Parents, for the purposes of COPPA compliance, including the following purposes: (1) for receiving notice of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information from their Children through the Service, and any changes to such policies; (2) for providing consent to such collection, use and disclosure; (3) for revoking the foregoing consent; (4) for requesting to review the personal information collected from their Children; and (5) for requesting to delete the personal information collected from their Children.

(b)	You agree to use the Service solely for the benefit of your School and the students in your School, and not for commercial purposes. If at any time your School does not have the authority to act as the agent of a Child Student’s Parent, you agree to notify us immediately. 

(c)	You, on behalf of the School (on behalf of each Child Student’s Parent), hereby (i) consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information of Child Students, through the Site, in accordance with the Children’s Privacy Policy and (ii) agree that the Child Student’s online activities are subject to these Terms of Use.

2.2 You can accept the Terms by:

(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Pear Deck in the user interface for any Service; or

(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Pear Deck will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

## 6. Billing and Payment

6.1 If you select a paid Services level, you may choose to subscribe and pay for the Services on either a monthly or annual basis and Pear Deck will bill the account administrator in advance for use of the Services. Pear Deck reserves the right to modify pricing at any time, provided however that Pear Deck will notify the account administrator of a paid level account by email prior to any monthly or annual price increase affecting that account. If you upgrade to a higher paid level or tier, Pear Deck will credit any remaining balance from your previous subscription payment to your new level or tier. You may choose to discontinue your paid level account at any time; however, Pear Deck does not issue refunds for unused subscription periods.

6.2 You agree to maintain valid and up-to-date billing information on file with Pear Deck. You may update this billing information at any time in your Account settings.

6.3 All payments due are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated on the subscription pricing page or invoice.

a. Credit Card or Debit Card. Fees for accounts where you are paying with a credit card, debit card or other non-invoice form of payment are due at the beginning of the month for which Services will be provided to you. For credit cards, or debit cards: (i) Pear Deck will charge you for all fees when due at the beginning of each service month or year, as applicable; and (ii) these fees are considered delinquent if not received at the start of each service month or year.

b. Invoices. Payments for invoices are due thirty days after the invoice date, unless otherwise specified, and are considered delinquent after such date.

c. Renewal. For paid levels, at the end of each annual or monthly subscription period (as applicable), the Services will automatically renew for an additional year or month, respectively. If you wish to change your subscription level or term, the account administrator must change the settings in the account administration console provided as part of the Services.

d. Other Forms of Payment. Pear Deck may enable other forms of payment by making them available in the account administration and payments page. These other forms of payment may be subject to additional terms which you may have to accept prior to using the additional forms of payment.

6.4 Delinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Pear Deck in collecting such delinquent amounts, except where such delinquent amounts are due to Pear Deck's billing inaccuracies.

6.5 Pear Deck will endeavor to notify you (or in the case of a Team account, your account administrator) if your paid account has delinquent fees. If delinquent fees are not paid, Pear Deck will automatically downgrade your account to a free Pear Deck account and/or suspend your use of the Services.

6.6 You are responsible for any taxes, duties, and customs fees associated with the sale of the Services (other than Pear Deck’s income tax) (collectively "Taxes"), and you will pay Pear Deck for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Pear Deck is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide Pear Deck with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to Pear Deck, you must provide Pear Deck with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.

6.7 These billing and payment terms may not apply if you are not subscribing to the Services directly from Pear Deck.

## 7. Your passwords and account security

## 20. Community Galleries

20.1 The Service may contain galleries that may present third party content ("Community Galleries"). Community Galleries include without limitation the Templates Library and any other gallery that Pear Deck chooses at its discretion to make available to you.

As between you and the creators of Gallery Content, any intellectual property or proprietary rights remain with the creators.

20.2 The Gallery Content: (a) is meant to serve as a suggestion only; and (b) is not a substitute for professional advice or specific, authoritative knowledge or direction. Pear Deck does not promise that the Gallery Content will work for your purposes, or that it is free from viruses, bugs, or other defects. The Gallery Content is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. You alone bear the risk of using Gallery Content. Pear Deck and its suppliers provide no express warranties, guarantees and conditions with regard to the Gallery Content.

You retain the right to stop distributing the Gallery Submission through the Pear Deck Community Galleries at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw the licenses granted to Pear Deck and its end users under these Terms of Service. In order to stop distributing the Gallery Submission through the Pear Deck Community Galleries, you must utilize the removal functions provided within the Services, in which case the Gallery Submission removal will be effective within a reasonable amount of time.

20.4 You represent and warrant that (a) you own or have obtained the necessary legal rights to provide all Gallery Submissions you submit through the Services, and will maintain these rights for as long as the Gallery Submission is available to Pear Deck end users; and (b) all of the Gallery Submission you submit through the Services abide by the posted Program Policies.

20.5 Pear Deck claims no ownership over any Gallery Submission you submit through the Services.

You agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Pear Deck has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

20.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Pear Deck has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Gallery Submission that you submit. Pear Deck is not in any way responsible for the subsequent use or misuse by Pear Deck end users who access your Gallery Submission.

You shall cooperate fully in the defense of any claim. Pear Deck reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. You acknowledge that damages for improper use of the Services may be irreparable; therefore, Pear Deck is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies. This section shall take precedence only over the indemnity provision provided in any Terms.

## 21. Changes to the Terms

21.1 Pear Deck may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, Pear Deck will make a new copy of the Terms available at http://www.Pear Deck.com/terms.

21.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Terms have changed, Pear Deck will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 22. General legal terms

22.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.

22.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Pear Deck and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Pear Deck may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Pear Deck in relation to the Services.

22.3 You agree that Pear Deck may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.

22.4 You agree that if Pear Deck does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Pear Deck has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Pear Deck’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Pear Deck.

22.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

22.6 The Terms, and your relationship with Pear Deck under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Iowa without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Pear Deck agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Iowa City, Iowa to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Pear Deck shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
